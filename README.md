# IMU Driver

in the future this should be an IMU driver. Currently it is a matlab interface.

## roadmap:

- create interface that opens a csv and spits tcp/ip

- change interface to udp

- create simple socket and get it to compile in opensimrt-docker

- crosstalk with c/c# interface, if it doesn't work try only C interface first

- adapt existing virtual classes from opensimrt to use this driver
